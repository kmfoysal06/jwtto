                <h2>What is JWT Decoder?</h2>
                <p>JWT Decoder is a simple, secure, and privacy-focused web tool designed to help developers decode and inspect JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Built with a minimalist approach, our tool provides essential functionality without unnecessary complexity.</p>

                <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
                <p>JSON Web Tokens have become a standard for authentication and information exchange in modern web applications. Developers often need to quickly inspect JWT tokens during development and debugging. We created this tool to provide a fast, secure, and user-friendly way to decode JWTs without compromising security.</p>

                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>100% Client-Side Processing:</strong> All decoding and verification happens in your browser. No data is ever sent to our servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signature Verification:</strong> Verify JWT signatures using HMAC algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512) with visual feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Decoding:</strong> See decoded header and payload information as you type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> Your tokens and secret keys remain completely private and secure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Free Forever:</strong> No registration, no ads, no tracking - completely free to use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Our code is transparent and available for review.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
                <p>We believe in simplicity and functionality. Our tool follows a minimalist design philosophy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean black and white interface with no distractions</li>
                    <li>Focus on functionality over aesthetics</li>
                    <li>No unnecessary animations or effects</li>
                    <li>Fast and responsive on all devices</li>
                    <li>Accessible to all users</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Security & Privacy</h2>
                <p>Security and privacy are our top priorities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All processing happens locally in your browser</li>
                    <li>No server-side logging or data collection</li>
                    <li>No cookies or tracking scripts</li>
                    <li>No external dependencies or third-party services</li>
                    <li>Open source code for transparency</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <p>JWT Decoder is built using standard web technologies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> For structure and semantics</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> For styling and layout</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> For JWT decoding and signature verification</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Crypto API:</strong> For secure signature verification</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
                <p>We are developers who understand the challenges of working with JWTs. This tool was created out of our own need for a simple, secure way to inspect tokens during development. We're committed to keeping this tool free, open, and privacy-focused.</p>
